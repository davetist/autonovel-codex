BOOK PROMPT PROFILE (generated from this book's foundation; obey over generic habits):
{profile}

FOUNDATION-ONLY RULE:
{contamination_warning}

VOICE DEFINITION (follow this exactly):
{voice}

THIS CHAPTER'S OUTLINE (hit every beat):
{chapter_outline}

CHAPTER FOCALIZATION:
{chapter_focus}

NEXT CHAPTER'S OUTLINE (for continuity -- end this chapter so it flows into the next):
{next_chapter}

PREVIOUS CHAPTER'S ENDING (continue from here):
{prev_tail}

WORLD BIBLE (reference for worldbuilding details):
{world}

CHARACTER REGISTRY (reference for speech patterns and behavior):
{characters}

CANON (hard facts; do not contradict):
{canon}

WRITING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Write the COMPLETE chapter. Target the approximate word count in the outline, or ~3,200 words if none is listed. Do not truncate or summarize.
2. Use the tense/person/focalization defined by the book profile and chapter outline. Stay locked to this chapter's focal consciousness.
3. Hit ALL numbered beats from the outline in order.
4. Plant ALL foreshadowing elements listed under "Plants."
5. Use sensory detail and metaphor domains drawn only from this book's profile, world, voice, characters, and current focal consciousness.
6. Preserve this book's speculative/world rules exactly as established in the foundation.
7. Dialogue follows the speech patterns defined in characters.md and the book profile.
8. No banned words from voice.md Part 1 guardrails.
9. No AI fiction tells: no "a sense of," no "couldn't help but feel," no "eyes widened."
10. Vary sentence length. Short sentences for impact. Longer ones to build.
11. Trust the reader. Don't explain what scenes mean. Let them land.
12. Start the chapter in scene, not with exposition. End on a moment, not a summary.

PATTERNS TO AVOID (book-independent craft guardrails):
13. NO triadic sensory lists. Never "X. Y. Z." or "X and Y and Z" as three
    separate items in a row. Combine two, cut one, or restructure.
14. NO "He did not [verb]" more than once per chapter. Convert negatives
    to active alternatives or just cut them.
15. NO "He thought about [X]" constructions. Replace with: the thought
    itself as a fragment, a physical action, or dialogue.
16. NO "the way [X] did [Y]" as a simile connector more than twice per
    chapter. Use different simile structures or cut the comparison.
17. NO over-explaining after showing. If a scene demonstrates something,
    do not have the narrator restate it. Trust the scene.
18. NO section breaks (---) as rhythm crutches. Only use for genuine
    time/location jumps. Max 2 per chapter.
19. VARY paragraph length deliberately. Never more than 3 consecutive
    paragraphs of similar length. Include at least one 1-2 sentence
    paragraph and one 6+ sentence paragraph.
20. END the chapter differently from previous chapters. Do not reuse a
    recurring closing image or inherited ending pattern; find the ending
    that belongs to THIS chapter specifically.
21. INCLUDE at least one moment that surprises -- a character saying
    the wrong thing, an emotional beat arriving early or late, a detail
    that doesn't fit the expected pattern. Predictable excellence is
    still predictable.
22. FAVOR scene over summary. At least 70% of the chapter should be
    in-scene (moment by moment, with dialogue and action) rather than
    summary (narrator compressing time).
23. DIALOGUE should sound like speech, not prose. Characters should
    occasionally stumble, interrupt, trail off, or say something
    slightly wrong when that fits their profile.

Write the chapter now. Full text, beginning to end.
